# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Firebase Data Retrieval

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Firebase Realtime Database interactions.  The issue arises when attempting to access nested data before ensuring it's fully loaded, leading to unexpected behavior and unhandled promise rejections. The solution provides best practices for safely handling asynchronous data retrieval and error management in Firebase.

## Problem Description
The primary problem is accessing deeply nested data from a Firebase snapshot without proper error handling and verification.  This can result in runtime errors if the expected data structure isn't present. 

## Solution
The solution incorporates robust error handling and data validation before accessing nested properties. This prevents unexpected errors and provides a cleaner user experience.
