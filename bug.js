The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to data retrieval and handling within a React application. The error arises when attempting to access nested data from a Firebase Realtime Database snapshot before ensuring the data is fully loaded and available.

```javascript
// Incorrect approach
const dataSnapshot = await getDatabase().ref('path/to/data').once('value');
const nestedData = dataSnapshot.val().nested.property;
// ... further operations using nestedData ...
```

This approach may lead to unexpected behavior or errors such as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')` because `dataSnapshot.val().nested` might be `undefined` if the 'nested' property doesn't exist or the data hasn't finished loading.
